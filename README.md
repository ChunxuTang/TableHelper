# Table Helper

Highlight and extract HTML tables from web pages

## What is it?
A Chrome extension to 

- highlight tables on a web page
- select and copy tables from a web page
- post table messages to another web page

## Why just posting table messages?
This extension is used in my research for real time data sharing and collaboration.
A pasting action is not enough for this purpose. So, I strip message handlers from
the extension, but put them in the web page side.

While, it's very easy to add necessary message handlers in `content_script.js` file.
